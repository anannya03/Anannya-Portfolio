              ello! I&apos;m Anannya,  a USC Computer Science Master's candidate with a knack for 
              building scalable solutions and a passion for impactful technology. From enhancing patient 
              care systems at Athenahealth to optimizing real-time scooter tracking at Bounce, I apply my expertise 
              in Python, Java, and a suite of backend technologies to solve complex challenges. I've also ventured into frontend development with 
              Angular, Vue, and NextJS and am currently exploring Machine Learning.
